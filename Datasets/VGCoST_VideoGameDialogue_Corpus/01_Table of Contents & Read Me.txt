Thanks for using the Video Game Corpus of Speech and Text! The corpus is absolutely free to use for anybody.
All text files should be compatible with any corpus analysis tool you wish to use. If any problems occur, feel free to send an email to the address below. 
Do so as well if you want to include your game into the corpus, or if you have any suggestions or enquiries.
The corpus was compiled by me, Pascal Wagner, as well as extracted from the games manually by me if not otherwise stated in the files.
Lines preceded with a @ sign in the files are additional information or notes not occuring in the game text; you should find it easy to exclude them from your research.

LEGAL INFORMATION:
All text belongs to the game it is from and is owned by the respective developer, publisher or artist. 
I do not claim ownership of them, I merely compiled this collection as a free and open object for research. 
It is protected as a database under German law §4 UrhG and free to use for research and schooling purposes under §§60a-h UrG. 
Where German law does not apply, the database is distributed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0. DO NOT distribute altered versions of the corpus. You are not allowed to use the corpus or any of its contents commercially in any way.
